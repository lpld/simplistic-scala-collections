# simplistic-scala-collections

Here is a great paper by Odersky and Moors that describes implemetation details of Scala collections library: http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/papers/fsttcs2009.pdf

This project is an attempt to create simplistic collections implemetation using the principles described in the paper. The purpose is to explore Scala's higher kinded classes and implicits.
